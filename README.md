# Attendee MCP Server

This is an MCP for sending and managing meeting bots with  [Attendee](https://github.com/attendee-labs/attendee), an open-source meeting bot for recording and transcription. You can run Attendee locally or deploy it to the cloud.

## Quick Start: What can you do with this MCP? 

Using Claude as an example: You can type the following and start working with an AI meeting bot.  

1. "Send a bot to this meeting: <meeting_url>"
2. "Have the bot speak 'Hello'", and the bot would say 'Hello' it in the meeting.
3. "Have the bot send a chat message: 'Glad to be here'", and the bot would write 'Glad to be here' in the chat.
4. "Have the bot leave the meeting"

## Combining MCPs 
Combining MCPs leads to powerful workflows. For example, I use the Brave Search MCP alongside the Attendee MCP. When I ask Claude, ‚ÄúWho won the last Roland Garros tournament?‚Äù, it:

1. Uses the web MCP to find the answer online.
2. Pipes the result to the Attendee bot, which speaks the answer back to me

## üöÄ Installation

We will use Claude as an example, but you can use any tool that works with MCPs.

### Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone your fork or the main repo
git clone https://github.com/rexposadas/attendee-mcp.git
cd attendee-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript
npm run build

# Link for global use
npm link
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for your Attendee server:

```bash
export MEETING_BOT_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"  # Your Attendee server URL
export MEETING_BOT_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"     # Your Attendee API key
```

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) to make them permanent.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Update your Claude Desktop configuration file at:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. after you make the changes, restart Claude 

#### Adjust the `mcpServers` section to include the Attendee MCP server.  Use the direct path for now since that's proving to be the most reliable.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "attendee": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "<path>/attendee-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MEETING_BOT_API_URL": "<attendee-url-here>",
        "MEETING_BOT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/attendee-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repository.
